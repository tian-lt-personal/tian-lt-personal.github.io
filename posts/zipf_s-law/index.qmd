Zipf's law is an **empirical** law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that for many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences, the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation. 

$$
f(k; s, N) = \frac{1/k^s}{\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^N (1/n^s)} 
$$
