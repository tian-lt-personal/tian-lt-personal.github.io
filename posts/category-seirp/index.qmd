*Search engines - information retrieval in practice* is a recommended book that shows a complete picture of search engine (web search, especially) and deliver detailed deep-dive into each engine components.

## Chapters that I would like to hightlight

### Chapter 2 - Architecture of a Search Engine
This chapter breaks down a search engine into well-define pieces, they are ***Text Acquisition, Text Transformation, Index Creation, User Interaction, Ranking, Evaluation***.

We can imagine a search pipeline like below picture:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
info(Information Contents)
usr(End User)
crlr(Crawler)
cp(Content Processer)
idx[(Search Index)]
qry(Query Interface)
anly(Analsis)

info --> crlr
crlr --> cp
cp --> idx
idx --> qry
cp -.-> anly
qry -.->anly
anly --> qry
qry --> usr
```
