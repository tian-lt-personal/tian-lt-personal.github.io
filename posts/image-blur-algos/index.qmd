Images can be filtered with either a high-pass filter or a low-pass filter. In general, high-pass filters are associated with the sharpening of an image and low-pass filters are associated with the smoothing of an image.

Algorithms we are going to talk about in this post:

1. Box blur
1. Gaussian blur
1. Bokeh (DoF)

## Box blur

## Gaussian blur

### Gaussian kernel
The Gaussian kernel is defined in 1-D, 2-D, and N-D respectively as
$$
G_{1D}(x; \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{- \textstyle \frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} \tag{1}
$$
$$
G_{2D}(x, y; \sigma) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2}e^{- \textstyle \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}} \tag{2}
$$
$$
G_{ND}(\vec{x}; \sigma) = \frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma)^N}e^{- \textstyle \frac{{\vert \vec{x} \vert}^2}{2\sigma^2}} \tag{3}
$$

### Gaussian kernel - separability
The Gaussian kernel for dimensions higher than one, say N, can be described as a regular product of N one-dimension kernels:
$$
g_{ND}(\vec{x}; \sum^N_{i=1} \sigma_i) = \prod^N_{i=1} g_{1D}(x_i; \sigma_i)
$$

For example, a two-dimensional gaussian kernel can be a product of 2 one-dimensional kernels:
$$
g_{2D}(x, y; \sigma_1 + \sigma_2) = g_{1D}(x; \sigma_1)g_{1D}(y; \sigma_2)
$$

## Bokeh (DoF)
Bokeh, also known as depth-of-field. In photography, **bokeh** is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in out-of-focus parts of an image.

Bokeh has also been defined as "the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light". Differences in lens aberrations and aperture shape cause very different bokeh effects.

> The term (bokeh) comes from the Japanese word boke (暈け/ボケ), which means "blur" or "haze", resulting in boke-aji (ボケ味), the "blur quality".
