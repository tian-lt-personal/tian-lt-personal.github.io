Images can be filtered with either a high-pass filter or a low-pass filter. In general, high-pass filters are associated with the sharpening of an image and low-pass filters are associated with the smoothing of an image.

Algorithmns we are going to talk about in this post:

1. Box blur
1. Gaussian blur
1. Bokeh (DoF)

## Box blur

## Gaussian blur

## Bokeh (DoF)
Bokeh, also known as depth-of-field. In photography, **bokeh** is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in out-of-focus parts of an image.

Bokeh has also been defined as "the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light". Differences in lens aberrations and aperture shape cause very different bokeh effects.

> The term (bokeh) comes from the Japanese word boke (暈け/ボケ), which means "blur" or "haze", resulting in boke-aji (ボケ味), the "blur quality".
