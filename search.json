In photography, bokeh is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in out-of-focus parts of an image.\nBokeh has also been defined as “the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light”. Differences in lens aberrations and aperture shape cause very different bokeh effects.\n\nThe term (bokeh) comes from the Japanese word boke (暈け/ボケ), which means “blur” or “haze”, resulting in boke-aji (ボケ味), the “blur quality”."
